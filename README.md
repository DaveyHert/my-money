# My Money React App
This project was made for my Personal Expense Tracker

## What it does

When it comes to tracking your spending, there can be different reasons for doing it. Maybe you’re curious about where your money is going, are working towards a specific goal, My Money lets you write expenses down as they happen so you can track your spending using a simple React App.

## Functions
It's a budget and expense tracker app that lets you sign up/sign in, authenticates you using Google Firebase Authentication and lets you create expenses made that are uploaded to Firestore as collections. Each authenticated user's expenses are isolated and are rendered for that specific user whenever they log into the app.


## How to get Started using My Money React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
